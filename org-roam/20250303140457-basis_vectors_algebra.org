#+title:Basis vectors, algebra

A set of basis vectors is a collection of vectors $e_0, \dots, e_n$ such that:

- All are linearly independent (for all $i, j$, $e_i \cdot e_j = 0$)
- All are unit length.

  In other words, they form an [[id:DC11600E-97A0-4110-8464-0B16EBE17298][Orthonormal set]].

We can move from one set of basis vectors to another with the help of the [[id:140317C3-BADC-448B-A856-9D82B1C99C38][Dot product]].

If we are rebasing to vectors like so:

\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
= \lambda\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix} + \mu\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}

Because the two basis vectors are linearly independent, we can dot product through by one and then the other to obtain the coefficients lambda and mu.
