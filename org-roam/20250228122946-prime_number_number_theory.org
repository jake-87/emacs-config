#+title:Prime number, number theory


A prime number is a number $>1$ with its only positive divisors being itself, and 1.

Inversely, a composite number is any number that is not 0, not 1, and not prime.

There are infinitly many prime numbers. This can be proven by the fact that if $n|k$, then $(n-1)\not |\, k$, and the factorial function.
