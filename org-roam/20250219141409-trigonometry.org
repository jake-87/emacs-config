#+title:Trigonometry

Trig is the study of circles and triangles.

** Functions:

The basic functions of trig are $\sin$ and $\cos$.

From there, $\tan$ is defined as $\frac{\sin}{\cos}$.

The inverses are as follows:

\begin{align*}
\cot &= (\tan)^{-1}
\\
\csc &= (\sin)^{-1} = \text{cosec}
\\
\sec &= (\cos)^{-1}
\end{align*}

** Domains and ranges

Sin and cos both have domains $\mathbb{R}$, and ranges $[-1, 1]$.

Tan has domain $\mathbb{R} - (2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}$, and range $\mathbb{R}$. (In other words, the domain is everything except odd multiples of $\pi/2$).

Cosec has domain $\mathbb{R} - n\pi$, and range $\mathbb{R} - (-1, 1)$.

Sec has domain $\mathbb{R} - (2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}$, and range $\mathbb{R} - (-1, 1)$.

** Even/Odd

Sin and tan are odd.
Cos is even.

** Periods

All of the sin and cos based function have a period of $2\pi$.

All of the tan based functions have a period of $\pi$.

** Identities:

*** Basic:

- $\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1$

- $1 + \tan^2 = \sec^2$

- $\cot^2 + 1 = \csc^2$
