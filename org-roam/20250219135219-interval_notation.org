#+title:Interval notation

Interval notation is notation for writing intervals (so profound!).

( translates into an exclusive bound: $x \in (1, 2)$ is $1 < x < 2$.

[ translates into an inclusive bound: $x \in [1, 2]$ is $1 \leq x \leq 2$.

These can be mixed and matched as desired.
If both bounds are exclusive, the interval is called "open", as it does not contain its endpoints.
If both bounds are inclusive, the interval is called "closed", as it contains its endpoints.
If there is a mix/match, the interval can be neither open nor closed. Fun!
