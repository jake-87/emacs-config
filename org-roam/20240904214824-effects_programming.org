Effects are "i don't know how to do this, but someone above me does"
so we give control to them, and then they can handle everything, and
throw control back to us when they're done

depending on how you do lexical effects, you can't "nicely" have first class
functions, which is pretty sucky! you'd end up being able to have functions
escape the scope in which they're used, which would not work no good because
then the handler might not exist anymore
