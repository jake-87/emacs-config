#+title:Dot product, algebra

The [[id:32A7773E-6EFF-42D4-84F9-F6A0C41366D1][Vector]] dot product $\bold{u} \cdot \bold{v}$ in R^n is defined as the sum

\begin{align*}
\bold{u} \cdot \bold{v} = \sum_{k = 1}^n \bold{u}_k \bold{v}_k
\end{align*}

The angle between two vectors $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$ is $\theta = \cos^{-1}(\frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|})$.

Therefore, $a \cdot b = |a||b|\cos(\theta)$.

In particular, vectors are orthogonal if $a \cdot b = 0$, $a \neq b \neq 0$. 

This commutes how you'd expect of multiplication. Notably, it is not associative, as the output is a scalar, not a vector.
Due to this, the dot product does not have an identity operation.
