Given a convex qualrilateral ABCD, the qualrilateral formed by the midpoints of the four sides is a parallelogram.

** Proof:

Let L, M, N, K be the midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA.

Defined a, b, c, d = vectors of AB, BC, CD, DA.

Note that a + b + c + d = 0.

LM = LB + BM = 1/2a + 1/2b.
KN = KD + DN = -1/2(d + c).

Since a + b + c + d = 0, it follows that 1/2(a + b) + 1/2(c + d) = 0.

Therefore, 1/2(a + b) = -1/2(c + d).

Therefore, LM = KN.

Therefore LMNK is a parallelogram, as it has two parallel sides of equal length.
