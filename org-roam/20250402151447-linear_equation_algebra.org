#+title:Linear equation, algebra

* Definition

A linear equation in variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is an equation of the form

\[
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = k
\]


* Definition v2

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix, and $T : R^n \to R^m$, $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$ be a linear function, and $b \in R^m$. We consider the linear
equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ and solve for $\mathbf{x}$. The system is homogeneous if $b = 0$ and inhomogeneus otherwise.

If the system if homogenous, $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ is a solution, and so are:

- sums of solutions

- multiples of solutions
