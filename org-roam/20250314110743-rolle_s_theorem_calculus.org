#+title:Rolle's theorem, calculus

* Definition

Let $f$ be a function $[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, [[id:67C73355-B947-423C-8847-FD4421206BD2][Continuous]] on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then, if $f(a) = f(b) = 0$, there exists a point $c$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

* Proof

Three cases.

** Case 1:

Suppose $f(x) = 0$ (or any other constant). Clearly, any $c \in (a,b)$ can be chosen such that $f'(c) = 0$.

** Case 2:

Suppose there is a point $d$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(d) > 0$.
By the [[id:DF553B7D-3702-45D4-B028-76A3AEE4A595][Maximum-minimum theorem]], $f$ attains a maximum at some point $c \in [a,b]$.
Moreoever, $c$ cannot be $a$ or $b$ as $f(d) > f(a) = f(b) = 0$.
Hence $c$ lies in $(a,b)$, and as $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ we have
$c = \text{maximum of f in interval}$, and so $f'(c) = 0$.

** Case 3:

Same concept as case 2, except $f(d) \leq 0$.
