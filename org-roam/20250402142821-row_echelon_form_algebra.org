#+title:Row echelon form, algebra


* Defintion

A matrix is in row echelon form if:

- All rows having zero entries are at the bottom
- The leading element (first nonzero element in each row) moves strictly to the right every row you move down

If there's any row with only one non-zero non-augmented entry, you can back-substitute solutions most of the time
