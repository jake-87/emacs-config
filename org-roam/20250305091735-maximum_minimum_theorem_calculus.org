#+title:Maximum-minimum theorem, calculus


* Definition

If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $f$ attains a maximum and minimum on $[a,b]$.

i.e., there exist points $c,d \in [a,b]$ s.t. $\forall x \in [a,b], f(c) \leq f(x) \leq f(d)$.

Closed interval is needed. So is continuity.

* Noncontinuous definition

Let $f$ be a real valued function on $[a,b]$.

If $f(c) \leq f(d) \forall d \in [a,b]$,  then $c$ is the global minimum on that interval.

Likewise for $\geq$.

If $f$ has a maximum/minimum on $[a,b]$, then we say $f$ attains its global maximum/minimum on $[a,b]$.

Notably, $f(c)$ must exist.
