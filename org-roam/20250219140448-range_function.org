#+title:Range, function

The range of a function is a subset of the [[id:1E50E745-4B5D-4EF7-A121-B594040BBD0A][Codomain]] such that the range is only the values actually output by the function.

For some $f : A \to B$, while the codomain is $B$, the range is the subset of $B$ that is possibly output by the function:

\begin{align*}
\text{Range}(f)& = \{ x \in B \, | \, f(y) = x \, , y \in A \}
\\
\text{Range}(f)& \subseteq \text{Codom}(f)
\end{align*}
