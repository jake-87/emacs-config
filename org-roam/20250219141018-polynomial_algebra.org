#+title:Polynomial, algebra

A function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is considered a polynomial if it takes the form

\[
f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + n_1x^1 + n_0x^0
\]

and the following are true:
- $n \in \mathbb{N}$
  
- $a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0 \in \mathbb{R}$
  
- $a_n \neq 0$


sum/product of roots:

by ones: -b/a
by twos: c/a
by threes: -d/a
by fours: e/a
etc
