#+title:Polar coordinates, calculus

* Definition

Coordinates defined not in terms of $x$ and $y$ positions, but instead of distance $r$ and angle $\theta$.

Polar coordinates are nonunique, as $\theta$ can wrap around.


* Cartiesian in terms of

All cartesian coordinates can be converted to polar through the substitutions:

\begin{align*}
x &= r\cos\theta
\\
y &= r\sin\theta
\end{align*}

We also have that

\[
r^2 = x^2 + y^2
\]

and

\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}
\]

as expected

* Calculus


We additionally have that, therefore:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}} = \frac{y'(t)}{x'(t)}
\]

If we also have that:

\[
x(\theta) = f(\theta)\sin\theta
\]

and

\[
y(\theta) = f(\theta)\cos\theta
\]

then we have that

\[
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{f(\theta)\cos\theta+f'(\theta)\sin\theta}{-f(\theta)\sin\theta+f'(\theta)\cos\theta}
\]

if $r=f(\theta)$ (and then $r' = \frac{dr}{d\theta}$) then:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{r\cos\theta+r'\sin\theta}{-r\sin\theta+r'\cos\theta}
\]
