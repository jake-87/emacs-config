* Definition

A $n \times m$ matrix is a matrix with $n$ rows and $m$ cols.

* Relations to linalg

If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix which can be transformed via row stuff to [[id:6ED51834-6053-45E0-AB13-282C70B00A90][Row echelon form]], then the [[id:899FC12C-6642-4DFA-B4FB-2C2584F352CA][System of equations]] $Ax = b$

- At least one solution for every $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ iff $A$ has no non-leading rows
- At most one, iff $A$ has no non-leading cols
- Exactly one if both

  A row is leading if it contains a leading term
  Same for a leading column

  so basically if the leading stuff is triangle then it's unique solution
