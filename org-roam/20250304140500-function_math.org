#+title:Function, math


A function with [[id:43C017CD-2092-4A2C-83F1-E6F3D4688E40][Domain]] $P$ and [[id:1E50E745-4B5D-4EF7-A121-B594040BBD0A][Codomain]] $Q$ is notated:

- $f : P \to Q$.

- $f = x \mapsto x^2$

- $f(x) = x^2$

In order for $f$ to be considered a function, it must be defined for every element of the domain, and must have one
element in the codomain for every element in the domain.
Additionally, all outputs of the function must lie in the [[id:1E50E745-4B5D-4EF7-A121-B594040BBD0A][Codomain]].
