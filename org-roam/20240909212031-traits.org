* Multiparameter notes:

From smasher on discord:

You can't do the instantiation/propagation technique that some do for single-parameter tc for multiparam tc. If you do, you need backtracking.
If you're doing the unification and then a separate trait resolution pass, then that will continue to work for multiparameter traits.

Multiparameter traits are kinda terrible for type inference, which is why, as you know, associated traits and fundeps exist. But those pose their own complexity in implementaiton

If you have let generalization, you will need to resolve some instances before generalization a type.
Processing a fundep might result in more constraints that need to be processed, so having some sort of constraint queue that you iterate over to a fixed point would be good.
