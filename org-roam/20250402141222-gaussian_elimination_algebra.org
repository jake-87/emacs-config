#+title:Gaussian elimination, algebra

* Defintion

basically you use a matrix to uhhhh do the thing with the eliminating rows and whatnot in order to solve it yeah :D

* Maple

\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

```
with(LinearAlgebra):
LinearSolve(M)
```
my beloved


* with more detail

basically you're trying to reduce the not-augmented part of the matrix to [[id:2F6120AB-95FE-4C28-AA36-58E0538371F0][Reduced row echelon form]] so you can read
the solutions off

you have these operations:

add/subtract multiples of rows to other rows
swap rows
:thumbsup:


you can't do stuff at the same time, do them one after each other please
