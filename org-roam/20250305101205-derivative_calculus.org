#+title:Derivative, calculus


* Definition

The *derivative* is a method of calculating the slope of the tangent at a point.

For some continuous $f : (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$, we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ if

\[\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\]

exists.

We denote this:

- $f'(x)$
  
- $\dv{f}{x}(x)$
  
- $\dv{x}f(x)$

* Definition part 2

The derivative function of a function $f : (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a function $f' : (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:

\(\forall x \in (a,b), f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\)


* Arithmatic rules

Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x$. Then:

- \[(f + g)' = f' + g'\]

- \[(fg)' = f'g + g'f\]

- $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2}$



* Chain rule

If $g$ is differentiable at $x$, and $f$ at $g(x)$, then

\[(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)\]



* Extra stuff

Differentiability implies [[id:67C73355-B947-423C-8847-FD4421206BD2][Continuity]], but not the converse.
