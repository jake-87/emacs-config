#+title:Critical point, calculus

* Definition

Suppose $f$ is defined on $[a,b]$. We say that $c : [a,b]$ is a critical point for $f$ if one (or more) of the following hold:

- $c$ is an endpoint $a$ or $b$ of the interval $[a,b]$.

- $f$ is not differentiable at $c$

- $f$ is differentiable at $c$ and $f'(c) = 0$.
