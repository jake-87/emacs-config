#+title:Concurrent altitudes, geometry


We can show that the altitudes of a triangle are concurrent:


        c

    e       d
        p

a                b


Solution. As shown in Figure 3, let the three vertices be A, B and C (coordinate vectors a, b,
c), and let D and E be the points at which the altitudes from A and B intersect the opposite sides
of the triangle. Finally, let P (coordinate vector p) be the point of intersection of the altitudes AD
and BE.

Then, we can prove the result by showing that P is also on the altitude from C to AB.
Now, as P is on the altitude from A to the opposite
side BC, we have that $AP$ is perpendicular to $BC$, and
hence $(p - a) \cdot (c - b) = 0$.
Similarly, we have $(p - b) \cdot (a - c) = 0$.

Adding these and equating terms, we can show that $(p - c)\cdot(a - b) = 0$, therefore showing that $CP \cdot BA = 0$.
Thus, CP is perpendicular to BA and P lies on the altitude from C to BA.
