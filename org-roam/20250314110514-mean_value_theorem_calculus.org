#+title:Mean value theorem, calculus

* Definition

Let $f$ be a function $[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, [[id:67C73355-B947-423C-8847-FD4421206BD2][Continuous]] on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then, there exists some $c \in (a,b)$ such that

\[f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\]

Essentially, there is some point where the slope is equal to the slope of the line between the two points.

This is a generalization of [[id:B54D8FE7-72AA-4A53-A930-A34AF9E51024][Rolle's theorem, calculus]], which assumes the RHS to be 0.

* Proof:

Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and diffentiable on $(a,b)$.
Then, let

\[g(x) = f(x) - \left( \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x-a)+f(a) \right)\]

One can check that $g$ is similarly continuous and differentiable, and that
$g(a) = g(b) = 0$.

Then, by [[id:B54D8FE7-72AA-4A53-A930-A34AF9E51024][Rolle's theorem]], there is a $c \in (a,b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$,
and therefore via expanding the definition of $g$,

\[f'(c) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = 0\]

and therefore

\[f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\]

as required.
