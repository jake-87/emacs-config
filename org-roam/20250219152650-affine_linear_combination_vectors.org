#+title:Affine linear combination, vectors

Any vector $\bold{x}$ can be written as an affine linear combination of two other vectors $\bold{a}$ and $\bold{b}$, as

\[\bold{x} = s\bold{a} + t\bold{b}\]

where $s + t = 1$.

Let $a$ be the endpoint of $\bold{a}$, and so on for $b$ and $x$.

Suppose $a$, $b$, and $x$ are colinear. If so, then $\bold{x}$ can be written as $\bold{x} = (1-t)\bold{a} + t\bold{b}$, which one may realize is the same as the formula
for a [[id:D5A5CE83-1253-47D4-904E-AD73960FB818][Line]], varying over $t$!
