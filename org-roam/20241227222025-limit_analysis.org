#+title:Limit, Analysis

The simplest **Limit** of some function f : ℝ → ℝ at a value k:

\[
\lim_{x\to k}f(x) = L
\]

is said to be L as x approaches k, if, for every ϵ > 0, there exists a δ > 0 s.t. for all x ∈ ℝ, (0 < |x - k| < δ) ⇒ ( 0 < f(x) - L < ϵ). In other words, it's essentially a "squeeze" saying that for every bit of closeness to the y value, you can get closer on the x axis
