#+title:Powerset

The **powerset** of a set S is every subset of S, including S itself:

\[
\mathcal{P} (S) = \{ s \, | \, s \subseteq S \}
\]

The cardinality of a powerset: if $| S | = k$, $| \mathcal{P}(S) | = 2^k$.

The proof of this is trivial; for every element s in S, it can either be included or excluded. Therefore, there are 2^n elements in the powerset.
